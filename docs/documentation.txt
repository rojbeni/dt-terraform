dt.host.cpu.usage
Represents total CPU usage on a host.
Includes all CPU time consumed by:
	User processes
	System/kernel processes
	I/O wait, interrupts, etc. (depending on OS)
Basically: dt.host.cpu.usage ≈ 100% - idle
Good for overall CPU load monitoring.

dt.host.cpu.user
Represents CPU time spent in user space only.
Counts only time the CPU spends running application processes (non-kernel).
Excludes:
	Kernel/system CPU time
	I/O wait or idle
Useful for analyzing application load specifically, ignoring OS/system overhead.


Custom Metric‑Based Alert
Dynatrace’s Terraform provider exposes a metric event resource (e.g., dynatrace_metric_events) that lets you define a custom alert on metric thresholds. This is the Terraform equivalent of “Custom Alerts” in the UI.

Alerting Profile with a Custom Event Filter
A more advanced route is to define an alerting profile that uses custom event filtering (e.g., by event title or description) so that only certain events are notified:
This profile filters incoming events and can route them with severity or to notification settings.


In the dynatrace_email_notification resource, the profile attribute is the link between your notification channel and the rules that trigger it.
What it does
It tells Dynatrace: "Send an email only when a problem matches the conditions defined in this specific Alerting Profile."
